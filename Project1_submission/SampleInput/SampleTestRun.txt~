Steps to execute :

1) Open three terminals and navigate to folder Project1_Submission.

2) On the first terminal 
	a. run the command ./run.sh which compiles all the files(server.c,device.c,sensor.c).
   	b. Run ./server SampleInput/GatewayConfiguration.txt

3) On Second Terminal run Device
	a. Run ./device SampleInput/DeviceConfigurationFile_1.txt

4) On third Terminal run sensor
	a. Run ./sensor SampleInput/SensorConfigurationFile_1.txt SampleInput/SensorInputFile_1.txt


Note : To simulate the above things for 1 gateway, 2 devices, 4 sensors below are the instructions to be executed in each of the terminals:

1) On the first terminal
	a. run the command ./run.sh which compiles all the files(server.c,device.c,sensor.c).
   	b. Run ./server SampleInput/GatewayConfiguration_1.txt

2)Run each of these on a new Terminal
	Run Devices : 
	c. Run ./device SampleInput/DeviceConfigurationFile_1.txt
	d. Run ./device SampleInput/DeviceConfigurationFile_2.txt

	Note* : c is connected to AreaId : 1
	        d is connected to AreaID : 2

	Run Sensors:
	e. Run ./sensor SampleInput/SensorConfigurationFile_1.txt SampleInput/SensorInputFile_1.txt
	f. Run ./sensor SampleInput/SensorConfigurationFile_2.txt SampleInput/SensorInputFile_2.txt
	g. Run ./sensor SampleInput/SensorConfigurationFile_3.txt SampleInput/SensorInputFile_3.txt
	h. Run ./sensor SampleInput/SensorConfigurationFile_4.txt SampleInput/SensorInputFile_4.txt

	Note* : e,f are connected to AreaID : 1
		g,h are connected to AreaID : 2
